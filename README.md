```
‚ò† First of all you have to ROOT the device- Redmi Note 13 Pro+ 5G [zircon]
So... follow these steps
‚Ä¢First you need to Patch boot.img using Apatch,
‚Ä¢Now put you'r device into fastboot mode & connect via usb cable.
‚Ä¢Flash boot.img both slot, bcz zircon have A/B partition.
‚Ä¢So, type these cmd= fastboot flash boot_a & fastboot flash boot_b & after that type cmd= fastboot reboot.
‚Ä¢After that install Magisk and give root permission via Apatch. 
‚Ä¢Now open Magisk and inside Magisk install Magisk using direct install.
‚Ä¢Now Magisk is Fully Working & your device is ROOTED, now uninstall Apatch.
```

The patching of Android kernel and Android system.

- A new kernel-based root solution for Android devices.
- APM: Support for modules similar to Magisk.
- KPM: Support for modules that allow you to inject any code into the kernel (Provides kernel function `inline-hook` and `syscall-table-hook`).
- APatch relies on [KernelPatch](https://github.com/bmax121/KernelPatch/).
- The APatch UI and the APModule source code have been derived and modified from [KernelSU](https://github.com/tiann/KernelSU).

# For Wireless Att@¬¢k

## Best Wi-Fi adapter for wireless pentesting using your rooted Android phone with Kali NetHunter, you‚Äôll want one that reliably supports monitor mode and packet injection, connects easily via OTG, and ideally offers dual-band (2.4 GHz & 5 GHz) support for broader testing capability.


## Adapters & Chipsets

- Alfa AWUS036ACHM (MediaTek MT7612U, dual-band)

Kali-friendly, supports monitor mode and injection, great balance between performance.


- Atheros and Ralink Chipset Favorites

Atheros AR9271 (e.g. TP-Link TL-WN722N v1, Alfa AWUS036NEH)

For solid Linux support, monitor mode, and injection .


- Ralink RT3070 (e.g. Panda PAU05, Alfa AWUS036NH)

Compatible and portable; Panda PAU05 is low-profile and stealthy .



- Realtek RTL8812AU / RTL8814AU Adapters

Dual-band adapters like Alfa AWUS036ACS, AWUS1900, ASUS USB-AC68 support 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz but may require manual driver installs .


## Comparison Table, Wi-Fi Adapters for Pentesting

| **Adapter / Chipset** | **Bands** | **Monitor Mode & Injection** | **Out-of-Box Support** | **Notes** |
|------------------------|-----------|------------------------------|-------------------------|-----------|
| **Alfa AWUS036ACHM (MT7612U)** | 2.4 + 5 GHz | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Best balance of performance and price; works well on NetHunter |
| **Atheros AR9271 (e.g., TP-Link TL-WN722N v1)** | 2.4 GHz | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Extremely reliable & stable; only older v1 supports this, newer versions don‚Äôt |
| **Ralink RT3070 (Panda PAU05, etc.)** | 2.4 GHz | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes | Compact and stealthy; great for travel kits |
| **Realtek RTL8812AU / RTL8814AU** | 2.4 + 5 GHz | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚ùå Needs driver | Very high performance with dual/quad antennas; more setup required |

- Compatibility with Android + NetHunter

Use a reliable OTG adapter to connect the Wi-Fi dongle to your Android device.

Many adapters‚Äîeven with good chipsets‚Äîmay need custom drivers or modules added to your Android kernel to function fully .

Configure adapter in Kali NetHunter for monitor, injection, and AP modes .


- Setup Tips for Android NetHunter

1. Connect via OTG cable‚Äîensure high-quality to avoid connection issues .


2. Ensure compatibility: check adapter chipset and that your Android kernel supports or can be modified to support required drivers.


3. Nethunter configure modes: monitor, packet injection, AP mode‚Äîvery helpful .
